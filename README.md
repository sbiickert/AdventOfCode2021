Code challenge solutions by me. [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

It's time for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021)! This year I'm going back to Swift. I've got a new M1 MacBook Air and I'm ready to work on those Swift skills. I won't be doing it in a Playground like [last year](https://github.com/sbiickert/SwiftAdventOfCode2020). I have started a command-line Mac app.

The big challenge for me this year will be to learn the [swift-algorithms](https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms) library. When I redid much of the [2020 Advent in C++98](https://github.com/sbiickert/AdventOfCode2020Classic) for fun last year, I learned a lot about the C++ STL and how to take advantage of it. I think this will be a great opportunity to dig into the Swift algorithms library.

Waiting for December...

## And We're Off!

A good start at 10 pm MST on November 30th. Got to use swift-algorithms right off the bat. Super clean solution, let's hope it continues.

## Five Days In

So far, so good. The difficulty seems to be ramping up gradually this year. The first four days were very straightforward and I spent equally as much time refining my solutions after getting the gold stars as I spent on the solutions. The swift-algorithms functions are coming in handy, and I'm loving it. I'm staying away from regex for parsing the input files. I learned last year in C++98 that you don't really need them.

The *really* fun thing, though, is that I've got a side project re-solving the puzzles in [Free Pascal](https://freepascal.org) on a Raspberry Pi. I can't promise I'll solve all of the puzzles, but I'm surprised myself so far.
