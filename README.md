# AdventOfCode2021
Code challenge solutions by me. [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

It's time for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021)! This year I'm going back to Swift. I've got a new M1 MacBook Air and I'm ready to work on those Swift skills. I won't be doing it in a Playground like [last year](https://github.com/sbiickert/SwiftAdventOfCode2020). I have started a command-line Mac app.

The big challenge for me this year will be to learn the [swift-algorithms](https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms) library. When I redid much of the [2020 Advent in C++98](https://github.com/sbiickert/AdventOfCode2020Classic) for fun last year, I learned a lot about the C++ STL and how to take advantage of it. I think this will be a great opportunity to dig into the Swift algorithms library.

Waiting for December...
